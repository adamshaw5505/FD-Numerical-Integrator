#  Finite Difference Numerical Integrator

This C++ will use the method of lines to numerically integrate an initial value problem on a 3D rectangular grid.

This code is adjustable such that any PDE system can be entered and it can also cope with dimensions less than 3.

The "Code Generator" folder contains rudimentary python/cadabra code to generate 1+3 field equations for the theory I wanted to use this program for.

## ToDO:
    - Add documentation comments and clean up code (the code is not very tidy atm)
